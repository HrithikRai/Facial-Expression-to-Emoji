Face-Moji :grin:
---
Do you ever wish you could display your emotions with emojis in real life? :speak_no_evil:
Well now you can! :scream_cat:

With real-time facial expresion detection :sunglasses:, we created a program that replaces
your face :man: :woman: with emojis :fearful: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.
Your friends :neckbeard: will never be confused about how you feel again! :sweat_smile:

To use this program, simply run `python expression.py` and smile for the camera! :grimacing:
The program should automatically display what you're really feeling deep deep down inside :neutral_face:

To run this program, the following libraries are needed:
1. opencv for python :zap:
2. tensorflow :boom:
3. keras :fire:

After that, enjoy sharing your program with your friends :family:
and make sure to give us a :+1: on twitter with the hashtag :hash:facemoji.

And btw, this program is waaaay better animoji :sunglasses:...
Just *face* it, you :nose: we are the best group.:smirk:
